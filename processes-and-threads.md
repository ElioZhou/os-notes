# Processes and Threads

A "processor" can only run one unit of execution (process/thread) at a time. The
processor is switched (context switch) among multiple applications so all will
appear to be progressing (albeit potentially at reduced speed). The processor
and I/O devices can be used efficiently: When application performs I/O, the
processor can be used for a different application.

## What is a process?

An abstraction of a running program.

### The Process Model

- A process has a program, input, output, and state (data).
- A process is an instance of an executing program and includes
  - Variables ( memory )
  - Code
  - Program counter ( really hardware resource)
  - Registers
  - ...

### Process: a running program

A process includes:

- Address space
- Process table entries (state, registers): Open files, thread(s) state,
  resources field

A process tree:

- A created two child processes, B and C
- B created three child processes, D, E and F

```
     A
   /   \
   B    C
 / | \
 D E F
```

### Address Space

- Defines where sections of data and code are located in 32 or 64 address space.
- Defines protection of such sections: ReadOnly, ReadWrite, Execute
- Confined "private" addressing concept: requires form of address virtualization

### Process Creation

- System initialization
  - At boot time
  - Foreground
- Background (daemons)
- Execution of a process creation system call by a running process
- A user request
- A batch job
- Created by OS to provide a service
- Interactive login

### Process Termination

- Normal exit (voluntary)
- Error exit (voluntary)
- Fatal error (involuntary)
- Killed by another process (involuntary)

## Implementation of Processes

- OS maintains a process table `Process procs[];`
- An array (or a hash table) of structures
- One entry per process (pid is the uniq id)

## Implementation of Processes: Process Control Block (PCB)

- Contains the process elements
- It is possible to interrupt a running process and later resume execution as if
  the interrupt had not occurred â†’ state
- Created and managed by the operating system
- Key tool that allows support for multiple processes

Includes: Identifier, state, priority, program counter, memory pointers, context
data, I/O status information and accounting information.

## Fork

Creation of a new process by `fork()`. Executing a program in that new process.
Signal notifications.

The kernel boot manually creates ONE process (the init process, pid=0) and all
other processes are created by `fork()`.

### `fork()`

```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include <unistd.h>
int main(int argc, char **argv) {
  pid_t pid = fork(); // syscall that creates new PCB and duplicates Address Space
  if (pid == 0) {
    // child process
  } else if (pid > 0) {
    // parent process
  } else {
    // fork failed
    printf("fork() failed!\n");
    return 1;
  }
}
```

### `execv()`

The `exec()` family of functions replaces the current process image with a new
process image.
